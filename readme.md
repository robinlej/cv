## ‚Ñπ **ABOUT**

In the midst of a career change, I am a **Junior Web Developer** looking for an internship in Belgium.

After working in communications for the past 6 years and a few months of self-learning in JavaScript / HTML / CSS, I joined the **bootcamp on Web Development from BeCode** at the beginning of 2022. Their philosophy of active learning worked very well for me: it calls for our own motivation to keep improving and at the same time guides us towards the technologies that we should be looking into. It also gave me the opportunity to work on projects with others.

Interested in accessibility issues.

## üî¨ **PROJECTS**

### ***1. Main projects***

- [*BeTogether*](https://github.com/robinlej/betogether) - Frontend in React *(team of 2)*
    
    > Desktop web app to allow BeCode learners to submit project ideas, see each others' projects and vote for their favorites. Creates groups according to the learners' preferences.
  
- [*OneTheater*](https://github.com/charlottelotte2021/OneTheater_app) - Frontend (vanilla) and Backend (Express) *(team of 3)*

  > Mobile web app to list all the theatre plays in Brussels according to their dates, names, theatre, comedians and keep them in a wishlist if interested.
  > 
  > The idea came from the lack of easy solutions to compare the seasons between theatres, making it a requirement to go on each theatre's website to check, compare, book.
  > 
  > The actual data was [scraped from the websites of the theatres](https://github.com/robinlej/scraping-fiesta-onetheater) using Playwright.

- [*ScriptaLinea*](https://www.scriptalinea.org) - Frontend components (CSS / vanilla JS) and connexion to the MySQL database with small PHP scripts

  > ScriptaLinea is the association for which I was working before operating my career change. In the 2 years there, I created a few components to improve the UI of the website: 
  > - a tag-based selection to sort the books published, 
  > - tabs for the radio episodes, 
  > - modal cards for the presentation of collectives (with integration of WCAG recommendations for accessibility), 
  > - a carousel with the latest news on the front page, 
  > - a better menu bar, 
  > - ... and lots of CSS tweaks here and there.
