## <span id="about">‚Ñπ **ABOUT**</span>

Changing careers after 7-months training in fullstack development and an internship as a Web App Developer at [HeartKinetics](https://heartkinetics.com/), I am a **Junior Web Developer** looking for an opportunity in Belgium.

After working in communications for the past 6 years and a few months of self-learning in JavaScript / HTML / CSS, I joined the **bootcamp on Web Development from BeCode** at the beginning of 2022. Their philosophy of active learning worked very well for me: it calls for our own motivation to keep improving and at the same time guides us towards the technologies that we should be looking into. It also gave me the opportunity to work on projects with others. During my internship at HeartKinetics, I was in charge of creating a dashboard for internal use displaying aggregated research data, which involved work with Vue.js / Nuxt and Plotly on the frontend, Kotlin on the backend.

Interested in accessibility issues.

*NB: most projects have a GIF preview in their Readme file to help you visualise them.*

### ***1. Main projects***

- *Dashboard for HeartKinetics* - Frontend in Vue with Nuxt, backend in Kotlin
  
  > *No preview available due to its confidential nature.*
  > 
  > Dashboard displaying and aggregating research data (patients, genders, BMI, heart conditions, evolution over time...).
  > 
  > Work done: sketch on **Figma**, components and CSS with **Vue.js** in **Nuxt**, graphs with **Plotly**, custom endpoints in a REST API in **Kotlin**.

- [*BeTogether*](https://github.com/robinlej/betogether) - Frontend in React *(team of 2)*
    
    > [Demo](https://betogether-becode.herokuapp.com/)

- [*OneTheater*](https://github.com/charlottelotte2021/OneTheater_app) - Frontend (vanilla) and Backend (Express) *(team of 3)*

  > [Demo](https://onetheater.herokuapp.com/) (mobile only)
  > 
  > Mobile web app to list all the theatre plays in Brussels according to their dates, names, theatre, comedians and keep them in a wishlist if interested.
  > 
  > The idea came from the lack of easy solutions to compare the seasons between theatres, making it a requirement to go on each theatre's website to check, compare, book.
  > 
  > The actual data was [scraped from the websites of the theatres](https://github.com/robinlej/scraping-fiesta-onetheater) using Playwright.

- [*ScriptaLinea*](https://www.scriptalinea.org) - Frontend components (CSS / vanilla JS) and connexion to the MySQL database with small PHP scripts

  > ScriptaLinea is the association for which I was working before operating my career change. In the 2 years there, I created a few components to improve the UI of the website: 
  > - a tag-based selection to sort the books published, 
  > - tabs for the radio episodes, 
  > - modal cards for the presentation of collectives (with integration of WCAG recommendations for accessibility), 
  > - a carousel with the latest news on the front page, 
  > - a better menu bar, 
  > - ... and lots of CSS tweaks here and there.
